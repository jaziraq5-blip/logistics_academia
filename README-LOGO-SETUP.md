# Logo Setup Instructions

## Problem
The logo image is not displaying because it's located in the `images/` directory but Next.js requires static files to be in the `public/` directory.

## Solution
You need to copy the logo image from the `images/` directory to the `public/` directory.

### Manual Steps:
1. Copy the file `images/photo_2025-10-03_19-10-54.jpg` to `public/logo.jpg`
2. Or rename it to `public/photo_2025-10-03_19-10-54.jpg`

### Command Line (if terminal works):
```bash
cp images/photo_2025-10-03_19-10-54.jpg public/logo.jpg
```

### Windows Command Prompt:
```cmd
copy images\photo_2025-10-03_19-10-54.jpg public\logo.jpg
```

### PowerShell:
```powershell
Copy-Item "images/photo_2025-10-03_19-10-54.jpg" "public/logo.jpg"
```

## Current Status
- ✅ Header component updated with modern design
- ✅ Logo component created with fallback
- ✅ Fallback logo (star symbol) will display if image is missing
- ⏳ Need to copy the actual image file to public directory

## Fallback
If the image cannot be copied, the website will display a beautiful star logo as a fallback until the image is properly placed in the public directory.
